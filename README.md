Things I (Roh) need to do (for the week):

Remaining Tasks:

Implement this:

 	void	expand_env_variables(t_list_header *var_list, t_token_node **tokens)
	{
		int			i;
		char		*old_value;
	
		i = -1;
		while (tokens[++i] != NULL)
		{
			if (tokens[i]->type == T_VAR)
			{
				old_value = tokens[i]->token_value;
				tokens[i]->token_value = expand_token_value(old_value, var_list);
				free(old_value);
			}
			else if (tokens[i]->type == T_PID)
			{
				old_value = tokens[i]->token_value;
				tokens[i]->token_value = get_pid_from_proc();
				free(old_value);
			}
			else if (tokens[i]->type == T_XVAR)
			{
				old_value = tokens[i]->token_value;
				tokens[i]->token_value = ft_strdup("\tfor now not implemented\t");
				free(old_value);
			}
		}
	}

Additional Error Handling and Testing:

Work Left: Ensure robust error handling across your execution flowâ€”especially with pipelines and redirections. Testing edge cases (e.g., multiple redirections, missing filenames, ambiguous syntax) is crucial to mimic bash behavior.

Testing Heredoc and Redirection:
Validate that heredoc, input, output, and append redirections behave as expected even when multiple are specified.

Signal Handling and Job Control (Optional/Advanced):

Work Left: If required by your project, you might also implement more advanced features such as proper signal handling for child processes and job control.
