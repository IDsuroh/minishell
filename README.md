Hey Miguel! I hope this readme finds you well!

Well, first of all I have done some reading myself and figured most of the articles I've read
about 'parsing' suggested making the Lexical Analyzer or Lexer which takes the input characters and 
puts the characters together into 'tokens', then and a Parser that processes the 
tokens according to a grammar and build the command table.

So I have tried implementing the helper functions and the strtok function to the main till I got
tired haha!!! But anyways, the links below are the articles and the git pages I saw! Let's keep it up!
