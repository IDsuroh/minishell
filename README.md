Things I (Roh) need to do (for the week):

Remaining Tasks:

===============================================================================================================================================================================

Optimize builtins:

export:

unset:

exit:

===============================================================================================================================================================================
Implement this:

All allocated memory at execution time needs to have a reference in almighty,
and needs to be freed from almighty and set to NULL during normal execution to avoid double frees.
It needs to be there so that if _exit _() is called it can free it before exit().
Otherwise just change the _exit _() parameters to add the other structures to free them.

===============================================================================================================================================================================

Additional Error Handling and Testing:

Work Left: Ensure robust error handling across your execution flowâ€”especially with pipelines and redirections. Testing edge cases (e.g., multiple redirections, missing filenames, ambiguous syntax) is crucial to mimic bash behavior.

Testing Heredoc and Redirection:
Validate that heredoc, input, output, and append redirections behave as expected even when multiple are specified.

Signal Handling and Job Control (Optional/Advanced):

Work Left: If required by your project, you might also implement more advanced features such as proper signal handling for child processes and job control.
